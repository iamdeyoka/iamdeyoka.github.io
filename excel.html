            <h2>About the Dataset</h2>
            <p>The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle, containing records on sales transactions, product types, store locations, and customer purchase behaviors over a six-month period. The dataset includes attributes such as transaction date, product categories, store locations, sales volume, and transaction counts. This rich dataset provided the basis for an in-depth exploration of Deyoka Coffee Shop’s sales performance across multiple dimensions.</p>
            <h2>Data Quality Assessment</h2>
            <p>Data quality is essential to ensure accurate and reliable analysis. The dataset was assessed and cleaned through several steps in Power Query, which helped to address data integrity issues. Here is a summary of the data quality processes applied:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Duplicates Removal: </strong>Any duplicate rows were removed to avoid skewed transaction counts or duplicated revenue data.</li>
                <li><strong>Missing Values Handling: </strong>Missing or incomplete values in product names or categories were filled based on contextual data when possible. For sales data, any missing entries were replaced with estimates where appropriate.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Type Standardization: </strong>Numeric fields, such as sales and quantity, were formatted consistently, and date fields were standardized to facilitate time-series analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Outliers Identification: </strong>High and low outliers in sales volume were reviewed to ensure they represented legitimate transactions and were not the result of data entry errors.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency Checks: </strong>Product and location names were standardized, addressing any variations in naming conventions across records.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Through these steps, the dataset was transformed into a reliable, high-quality foundation for meaningful analysis.</p>

                <h3>High-Performing Products:</h3>
                <li><strong>Insight: Barista Espresso, Brewed Chai Tea, and Hot Chocolate</strong> are the top sellers, making up a significant portion of total sales.</li>
                <li><strong>Recommendation: </strong>Consider expanding the variety of these top-selling products to include seasonal or limited-time flavors. For instance, introducing a holiday-inspired espresso or chai tea might attract additional interest during peak periods. Promoting these items through customer loyalty programs or social media can also capitalize on their popularity.</li>
                <h3>Balanced Location Sales:</h3>
                <li><strong>Insight: </strong>Sales are evenly distributed across Hell's Kitchen, Astoria, and Lower Manhattan, with each location contributing significantly to overall revenue.</li>
                <li><strong>Recommendation: </strong>Conduct location-specific marketing campaigns to amplify sales further. For instance, partnering with nearby businesses or hosting events at specific locations could boost foot traffic. Additionally, studying demographic data for each area could unveil targeted promotion opportunities, such as exclusive discounts for local residents or office workers.</li>
                <h3>Customer Time-of-Day Preferences:</h3>
                <li><strong>Insight: </strong>Afternoon transactions dominate with 56% of sales, suggesting that customers prefer visiting during these hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Recommendation: </strong>To boost morning sales, consider offering special morning deals, such as discounted breakfast bundles or coffee-and-pastry combinations. Evening sales could benefit from promotions aimed at customers seeking a relaxed, evening atmosphere, like happy hour discounts on specific beverages or desserts.</li>
                <h3>Sales Trends Over Time:</h3>
                <li><strong>Insight: </strong>The sales trend line suggests higher sales on weekends, with notable peaks during specific weeks.</li>
                <li><strong>Recommendation: </strong>Utilize this trend to plan promotional events or limited-time offers aligned with peak sales periods.

Additionally, resource allocation—such as staffing and inventory—can be strategically adjusted to meet these peak demands efficiently.</li>
                <h3>Product Category Opportunities:</h3>
                <li><strong>Insight: </strong>While Coffee and Tea are top categories, other items like Drinking Chocolate and Flavored Beverages show steady but lower transaction volumes.</li>
                <li><strong>Recommendation: </strong>Introduce bundled offers that combine popular items (e.g., espresso) with lower-transaction items (e.g., flavored beverages). This approach may increase awareness and encourage customers to try a broader range of products, helping to diversify sales.</li>
